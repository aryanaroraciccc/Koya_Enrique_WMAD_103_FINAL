      Already a hit in major cities like London, Paris, New York, L.A. and Montreal, blind dining is finally coming to Vancouver, offering a unique opportunity to experience dining in a whole new way—in the dark. An evening at Dark table will take you on a culinary journey through uncharted territory, where the familiar—food, drink and friends—becomes a wonder to be explored and discovered, as if for the first time.
      Without the sense of sight, the senses of touch, taste, hearing and smell are intensified, allowing a new perception of reality. Dark Table is open now in Kitsilano, at 2611 W4th, offering Vancouver exceptional cuisine, superb service and a voyage to the unknown.

      <p class="description-title"><span>How it</span> works <span>?</span></p>
      Upon arrival, take your time and choose from a first-class menu rivaling some of Vancouver’s best restaurants.

When you're ready, you'll be led to your table in the dark dining room by a blind, or visually impaired server who has been trained to ensure your comfort at all times.

Once seated, you'll have the opportunity to adjust to the darkness and truly give yourself to this extraordinary experience.

No light producing technologies are allowed in the dining room, including flashlights, cellphones, or luminous watches.

        The blind dining concept originated in Switzerland in the home of a blind man—Jorge Spielmann—who blindfolded his guests in an attempt to show them what eating is like for a blind person.<br/><br/>

  Spielmann's guests enjoyed the experience immensely, and claimed that when their sense of sight was removed, taste, smell, hearing and touch were amplified to the extent that the social act of eating took on a whole new meaning. These initial dinners evolved into a restaurant concept that included a dark dining room and blind servers, a tradition that Dark Table will continue.<br/><br/>

  With an unemployment rate of 70%, the blind face obvious challenges in a society that is preoccupied with visual communication, but in a dark dining environment, the tables are turned—the non-sighted servers guide the sighted.<br/><br/>

  While Dark Table is proud to offer employment to blind and visually impaired people, we admit that it is truly the blind offering this unique, eye-opening experience to the sighted.</p>
