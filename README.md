## :spaghetti: Why we choose this project
I decides to choose this project because "DarkTable" is a restaurant I enjoy visiting a lot with friends every now and then; So we choose this page because We notice that they have a poor website with leak of important elements and properties to give the user a better navigation experience. We believe that such a unique restaurant with a unique experience needs a unique website. We are interested in combining the layout they already have and merge it with our code to to enhance it and make it look more professional.

## :sushi: How we divide the work
We communicated on Slack.  
First we decided which pages to make and which not to make.  
We ended up making 4 pages, so we decided to split the work 2 pages each.

## :cocktail: What we learned and what we struggle the most

### Enrique
I learned how to deliver the proper information to de user without making the site too busy or unresponsive; also learned how important is to plan before start coding, creating sitemaps, wireframes, and mockups.
Learned the way users interact to content in the site and the way a user scans a site in an "F-shape pattern, from top to bottom, right to left. I also learned how to create a user friendly site and a responsive design that can adapt any screen size. GitHub was another thing I learned, like how to create a Repo, branches, Git commit, pull requests and more but most importantly, I learned how to collaborate with team members in the same project remotely, using all the tools we have to empower us to deliver the best of Us in our projects! 

### Koya
I struggled to manage the time and prioritize the tasks.  
We only had 1 week and of course we were not able to work on the project 24/7. But we had to produce some results.  
To manage the project and produce the output:  
- I considered the amount of work that could be done in a week to produce some results. And I proposed that to my teammates.
- I always tried to keep everything simple, including communication, work and Git branch strategy.
- In the middle of the week, I reviewed the work and schedule again and changed priorities.
Through this experience, I learned how to manage schedule, prioritize the tasks and how much to compromise.

## :fried_shrimp: Future improvements
### Enrique
For future improvements we are planning to excel the web site so we can showcase it and present it to the restaurant's owner with all the updates, fixes and new features. also have all the structure preparation (code) ready to be able to update the site in case the owner decides to open a new branch, so it can be easy to integrate a new location, menu or section to the current site.
And finally we plan to try to sell them the service and get them as our customer for future sites, projects or updates in the existing one.

### Koya
I don't have any future plans about this project.  
But I think the experience I gained through this project will be useful in the future.  
Especially:
- How to communicate team members online
- How to split the work
- How to prioritize and compromise the tasks
